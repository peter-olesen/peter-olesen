### Howdy Partner ðŸ¤ 

I'm a recently graduated web developer from TECHCOLLEGE, currently working on personal projects to continue learning and gain hands-on experience.

Iâ€™m comfortable with HTML5 and CSS3, and I have a basic â€” but steadily growing â€” understanding of JavaScript. Iâ€™ve also begun working with React and enjoy building dynamic, interactive interfaces. I use GitHub for version control, although Iâ€™m still learning the ins and outs of Git itself.

Iâ€™m always open to small projects or collaborations, especially those that help me learn and grow as a developer.
